# An Introduction

If this goes well, this should render as a readable blog entry.

## Purpose

I'm essentially using this as my test Markdown file – this file is intended to contain a mix of elements[^1].

### Most days

- [x] wake up
- [x] get up
- [x] get out there

### Today, specifically

#### On my plans

I'm working on setting up this blog.

> It does not matter how slow you go so long as you do not stop.

#### On the weather

```ruby
class Sky
  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end
end

class Sun
  def initialize(brightness)
    @brightness = brightness
  end
end

sky = Sky.new('blue')
sun = Sun.new('bright')
```
