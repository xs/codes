# Hi, it's me.

If this goes well, this should render as a readable[^1] web page.

## Purpose

I'm essentially using this as my test Markdown file – this file is intended to contain a mix of elements, including, but not limited to, the following:

- headers of all kinds
- lists that are...
  - ordered
  - unordered
- images?
- a whole bunch of typographic styles
- and more! (like special Github-flavored markdown)

### A todo list for your daily life

- [x] wake up
- [ ] get up
- [ ] get out there

```ruby
def hello
  puts "hi, it's good to be here"
end
```

[^1]: Will these footnotes work? I guess we'll find out.
