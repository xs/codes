[^1]: but wait, what if this post also[^2] has footnotes[^3]?
[^2]: "also" here refers to the previous post ("hello world"), which also has a footnote. there was previously an issue where both footnotes would be rendered with the same id, causing issues when linking. this has since been fixed!
[^3]: speaking of footnotes, we're **also** going to find out here if footnotes themselves can have footnotes. (they can!)
