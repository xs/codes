From August 7th to October 27th, 2023, I spent twelve weeks at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). This is my take on how it went.

## Not a bootcamp

As the weeks went on, I continually refined the spiel I gave when telling people what I was doing day-to-day. Most people in my industry who are not familar with Recurse Center associate 12-week programs with bootcamps, generally designed to provide some basic amount of knowledge necessary for an entry-level position in [INSERT TECH INDUSTRY ROLE HERE].

Recurse Center explicitly bills itself as [not that](https://www.recurse.com/not-a-bootcamp). But when we define a thing it's maybe not enough to say what that thing isn't, and instead also try to explain what that thing fundamentally is.

I mostly oscillated between the following categorizations:

- "I'm attending something like a writers retreat, but for programmers"
- "I'm doing an independent research program for software"
- "I'm exploring the intersection of computers and weird things"

The first of these comes from the official Recurse Center materials, but it usually wasn't really enough to explain what I was doing â€“ for one, neither I nor most people I talked to had ever attended a writers retreat.
